# A Parallelized Multi-Objective Dynamic Sampling Framework for Analytical Electron Microscopy

This is a work in progress supplement to the publication [Hujsak, Karl A., et al. "High Speed/Low Dose Analytical Electron Microscopy with Dynamic Sampling." Micron (2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968432817304821).  

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Currently tested with:

```
python 3.5.3
multiprocess 0.70.5
numpy 1.11.3
scikit-learn 0.18.1
scikit-image 0.12.3
```

## Running the scripts

```
python DynamicImageClass.py -n TrainingImage.py
```
